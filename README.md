# Notion AI Vocabulary Bot

[English](README.md) | [中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

## 🧠 Quiz System (AI-powered Vocabulary Review)

This project includes an automated quiz system designed to help you review vocabulary efficiently using **spaced repetition** and **active recall**.

The quiz content is generated by **Google Gemini**, synchronized with **Notion**, and scheduled via **GitHub Actions**.

### ✨ What does this quiz system do?

- Automatically generates **multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** for new vocabulary
- Prevents overwriting existing questions once they are created
- Helps you practice **active recall** instead of passive reading
- Designed around a simplified **Ebbinghaus forgetting curve** (up to 3 reviews per word)

### 📝 When is a quiz generated?

A quiz is generated **only once** for a word, under the following conditions:

- The word exists in the Notion database
- `Question` field is empty (no quiz has been created yet)
- The word reaches a valid review stage

Once a quiz is created, it will **never be overwritten automatically**.

### 📊 Notion Fields Used

| Field Name   | Type      | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Question     | Text      | Stores the generated MCQ question |
| Answer Key   | Text / Select | Stores the correct answer (A/B/C/D) |
| My Answer    | Select    | User's selected answer |
| Check        | Status / Select | Correct or Wrong |
| Quiz Due     | Checkbox  | Indicates whether the word is due for review |
| Last Quiz    | Date      | Last quiz attempt date |

### 🔒 Why quizzes are never overwritten

To preserve learning history and avoid confusion:

- A quiz is generated **only if the `Question` field is empty**
- Existing questions are treated as immutable
- Regeneration is intentionally not automatic

This ensures that previously answered questions remain stable and reviewable.


### 🤖 Automation

The quiz system runs via **GitHub Actions**:

- Triggered by a scheduled workflow (cron)
- Can also be run manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- No local execution is required

The workflow:
1. Queries Notion for eligible words
2. Generates quizzes using Gemini
3. Writes results back to Notion

### 🧩 Design Philosophy

This system prioritizes:
- **Active recall over memorization**
- **Automation over discipline**
- **Stability over frequent regeneration**

Once a question exists, the learner—not the system—decides how to engage with it.
